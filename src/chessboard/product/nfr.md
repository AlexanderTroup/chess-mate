# Non Functional Requirements

- Works with chess.js
- TypeScript compatible
- stylable
- Entirely works on the keyboard
- complies with AA standard accessibility guidelines

## Points to note

Intention is to be an _analysis first_ board. So rather than being setup to play, it's setup to modify fast. 
Extra: build it for Yassir Chess, or later the extra mods.

This project will eventually move to its own NPM package, too.
