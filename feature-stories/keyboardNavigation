Could use TAB to tab between squares, or alternatively it could be used to navigate pieces on the board or at the top.

What if a user wants to remove the piece? press R?
What if the user wants to change the colour of a piece? press B or W to specify?

pwr = place white rook
pbp = place black pawn
Imagine if you could navigate around the chessboard entirely on the keyboard?
